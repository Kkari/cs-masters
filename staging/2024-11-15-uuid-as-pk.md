Do you remember that I said that UUID is less efficient in Posgres as a primary key than autoincrement numbers? Now I also understand why.
(There is a great episode in Postgres.fm about it, and a good article, but let me quickly summarise it for you, so for UUID as PK:
 
The Advantanges:
No sequential information leak to the outside world.
Able to generate keys independently of the database.
Able to move sets of related records between different databases without having to deal with renumbering everything.
Disadvantages:
(Are bigger: 16 bytes instead of a 4 byte integers.)
You loose temporal locality on the index because the recently added entries will be added to random locations in your index. That means:
Inserts will become slower because they will need an additional page-hit. For small tables it is a buffer hit, but if your index is big enough that it cannot be in the memory, then it might even spill to disk. 
Counting will become much slower because you cannot use an optimisation for the index called the visibility map. Which relies on the index and the page values being correlated with each other, hence being on roughly the same place. In the article that I have read, even with all pages in the buffer, counting a UUID index takes twice as much time as counting an integer index. The test was done with 10 million entries.
