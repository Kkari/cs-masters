title: "So how did this all started?"

After my Computer Engineering B.Sc. in Hungary life happened and I ended up working for seven years in Berlin, learning the art of business software development.

I was always thinking about going back to University but it turns out that lifestyle inflation is a real thing and I did not have the means to comfortably finance a masters degree. However, I discovered that especially after COVID-19 happened, a lot of American top institues opened up courses on youtube. Among them the CMU Database Group. 

As luck would have it, I love geeking out about systems programming and databases, so I decided that I put together a programme that is to my assessment roughly similar in size to the CMU masters degree. Although people who studied there would probably beg to differ...

Annnyway, this presents for me a nice opportunity to enjoy the deep dive of an advanced degree in my own pace and on agreeable terms.

I plan to upload here all my homework and write a little blog about it out of two reasons:
* So that I have a place to reflect and celebrate my little achievements.
* To show people that I really did this, for the lack of having an official certificate.

Thanks for reading!
Stay tuned, next time I will release the courses plan I am planning to take. :)
