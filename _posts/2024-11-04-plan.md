# The reason to study

After my bachelor I worked at the German industrial sector, then at an Insurtech. In the last 8 years I focused on a single application space and tech stack: 
Writing enterprise applications with Spring Boot. 

I learned a lot during that time about:
* Writing clean and well-formed business applications.
* Leading projects and engineering teams.
* Organising hiring and optimising pipelines.
* How to set up and run an engineering department. 

Nevertheless, I always wanted to deepen my understanding in a more systems-related technical area.

AI and ML was the point of my Bachelors, but at this point in my career that would be hard to incrementally build on top of my current knowledge. Also, I am more of a systems geek than a maths person. I also don't see myself as an enterpreneur at this point, sacrifising a lot of time or money for an own project that might fail. 

I was always interested in Databases, and I chose that as a way to go. The CMU Database Group shared world class education over Youtube that is I think far better than what is available in most of Europe, let alone Hungary. So I chose to learn all of their courses as the backbone of my masters degree and document the process on Github as a proof, since I will not have any papers about it. Except the homeworks, because they asked us not to upload them anywhere.

There are two main reasons I chose this path over a masters curriculum:
* The lectures from CMU, MIT and Stanford available on Youtube seem to be higher quality than what is reasonably available to me in other institutions. 
* I would like to be flexible with my time.

The main drawbacks of this approach are:
* The lack of accreditation, that I would like to balance out with this blog.
* The lack of a student community.
* It will just take a lot longer probably. But life is long.


## The north star

The masters level knowledge should focus on:
* Databases and data systems as a primary focus, plus a related complementary advance classes in: distributed systems, compilers or full-text search.
* The process should be documented in a blog and on Github as a proof and also as a place for reflection.
* The goal is either to work on data systems, or apply the knowledge in enterprise systems.

## The Roadmap
I want to finish the following courses:
* [High-Performance SQL and JPA from Vlad Michaela]()
